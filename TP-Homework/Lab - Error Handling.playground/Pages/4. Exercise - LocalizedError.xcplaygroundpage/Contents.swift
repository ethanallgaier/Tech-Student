## Exercise - LocalizedError
 
 A better approach to the previous exercise might be using the LocalizedError protocol, so that the printed output of each error is contained in a `errorDescription` property. Using the error messages you created in the last step, change `CommunicationError` to conform to `LocalizedError`. Add an `errorDescription` computed String property, switching on self to return the appropriate message.
 */

enum CommunicationError: Error {
    case networkServiceUnavailable
    case invalidMessage(String)
    case timedOut(waitTime: Int)
    case cancelledByUser
    case rejectedByServer(reason: String)
    case unknown
}

func sendPacket() throws {
    let randomNumber = Int.random(in: 0..<6)
    
    switch randomNumber {
    case 0:
        throw CommunicationError.networkServiceUnavailable
    case 1:
        throw CommunicationError.invalidMessage("\"outGonigMessage\": \"Hi!\"")
    case 2:
        throw CommunicationError.timedOut(waitTime: 5)
    case 3:
        throw CommunicationError.cancelledByUser
    case 4:
        throw CommunicationError.rejectedByServer(reason: "You're a bot!")
    default:
        throw CommunicationError.unknown
    }
}

/*:
 Now, use only one catch block below to catch all errors, printing the error's `errorDescription` to the console. Test your code several times.
 */

do {
    try sendPacket()
} catch let error as CommunicationError {
    switch error {
    case .networkServiceUnavailable:
        print("service error")
    case .invalidMessage(let message):
        print("Invalid message: \(message)")
    case .timedOut(waitTime: let waitTime):
