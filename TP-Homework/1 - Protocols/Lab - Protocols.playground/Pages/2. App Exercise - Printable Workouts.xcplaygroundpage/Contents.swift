/*:
## App Exercise - Printable Workouts

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 The `Workout` objects you have created so far in app exercises don't show a whole lot of useful information when printed to the console. They also aren't very easy to compare or sort. Throughout these exercises, you'll make the `Workout` class below adopt certain protocols that will solve these issues.

class Workout: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable, Comparable, Codable {
    
    var distance: Double
    var time: Double

        self.distance = distance
        self.time = time

    //This one is for comparable
    static func < (lhs: Workout, rhs: Workout) -> Bool {
        return lhs.identifier > rhs.identifier

//:  Make the `Workout` class above conform to the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol so that printing an instance of `Workout` will provide useful information in the console. Create an instance of `Workout`, give it an identifier of 1, and print it to the console.
var results = Workout(distance: 2.2, time: 5.0, identifier: 1)
//print(results)
//:  Make the `Workout` class above conform to the `Equatable` protocol. Two `Workout` objects should be considered equal if they have the same identifier. Create another instance of `Workout`, giving it an identifier of 2, and print a boolean expression that evaluates to whether or not it is equal to the first `Workout` instance you created.
var results2 = Workout(distance: 2.2, time: 5.0, identifier: 2)

if results == results2 {
    print("You got the same results")

    print("You didnt get the same results")
}
//print(results2)
/*:
 Make the `Workout` class above conform to the `Comparable` protocol so that you can easily sort multiple instances of `Workout`. `Workout` objects should be sorted based on their identifier. 
 
 Create three more `Workout` objects, giving them identifiers of 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Then create an array called `workouts` of type `[Workout]` and assign it an array literal with all five `Workout` objects you have created. Place these objects in the array out of order. Then create another array called `sortedWorkouts` of type `[Workout]` that is the `workouts` array sorted by identifier.

var workouts: [Workout] = [workoutTwo, workoutOne, workoutThree]

var sortedWorkouts: [Workout] = workouts.sorted(by: >)

for workouts in sortedWorkouts {
    print(workouts)
}
//:  Make `Workout` adopt the `Codable` protocol so you can easily encode `Workout` objects as data that can be stored between app launches. Use a `JSONEncoder` to encode one of your `Workout` instances. Then use the encoded data to initialize a `String`, and print it to the console.
let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()
if let jsonData = try? jsonEncoder.encode(3.0),
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8) {
